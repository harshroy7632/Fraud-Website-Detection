# Fraud-Website-Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent websites using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains information about various websites, including their URL, IP address, geographical location, and more.

The project uses three machine learning models for fraud website detection:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost

Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is used to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a website is fraudulent or not based on various features such as the website's URL, IP address, geographical location, and more. The model uses a logistic function to estimate the probability of a website being fraudulent and then applies a threshold to make a prediction.

Random Forest:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make a prediction. In the context of fraud website detection, the Random Forest algorithm is used to identify important features that contribute to identifying fraudulent websites. It uses a random subset of the features and observations to build a decision tree, and then repeats this process multiple times to create an ensemble of decision trees.

XGBoost:
XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that uses an ensemble of weak decision trees to make a prediction. In the Fraud Website Detection project, XGBoost is used to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a website is fraudulent or not. The algorithm uses a combination of gradient boosting and regularization techniques to reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model.
